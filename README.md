# zupa-setup
A script for installing my personal Dev essentials unsing homebrew. You might need to mark it as executable using `chmod 755 zupa-setup.sh`.  

Run it by using `./zupa-setup.sh`, you may have to provide your password for some formulae/casks!

You can fork and adapt the script easily by simply adding/removing formulae/casks to the lists in the script.  
To browse formulae and casks, visit: https://formulae.brew.sh/
